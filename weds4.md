1. When applying the style transfer, I tried adjusting several different settings
in the code. For example, I increased the epochs to 5 and increased the steps_per_epoch to 50 and 100.
   I also tried changing/increasing the style_weight (but not the content_weight) to see if the image would become more
   abstract. I think it worked but it was difficult to tell whether it was the different number of steps
   per epoch or the style_weight that was making the small difference. Changing all of these settings
   resulted in slightly different colors being emphasized or different lines in the picture being more or less blurry.
   
2. Of course, I had to choose Irises when reflecting on my time in data science at William and Mary. The first picture 
especially is accurate to my experience because, while it might not be as elegant as the second one, it 
   accurately shows how there were very few straight lines over the course of the summer; classes and projects always 
   required a lot of thought and had their own challenges each time. The colors are a mix of light and dark
   to contrast the good and bad moments and the chaos is definitely accurate for this summer between trying to balance a job, school work, hobbies,
   family, and friends. In the end though, what came out of it was something 
   beautiful that will continue to grow in the future as I continue to pursue data science.
