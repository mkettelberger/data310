*ABSTRACT*

Genetic mutations happen spontaneously and constantly. In the past decade, scientists
have seen worrying mutations develop in the DNA of bacterial genomes that make them resistant
to antibiotic treatments and provide them with other novel ways to survive. Given the vast number of
bacterial species both known and unknown across the world, it's important to keep track
of these genetic differences because they can be passed between bacteria in several ways.
Using machine learning and training models, my goal is to read over collections of genetic sequences
from several different species, and determine whether or not there are any new sequences that were
not present in the training data. These novel sequences are referred to as "out-of distribution" or OOD 
and can indicate mutations to watch out for. Teaching the model how to determine if specific genes
contain OODs with high levels of accuracy will save scientists lots of time and let them focus on developing
solutions, as they don't have to manually read through the genomes.
